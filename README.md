# WWIKT — Who Will I Know There?

A simple project to help you find friends when you're moving somewhere totally new. Going off to college? Need a support network? Log in with your Facebook to find friends (and friends of friends) near your new home.

Moving somewhere new is scary, especially if you don't think that you'll know anyone there.
Yes, you could actually *talk* to your friends to see if they know anyone you would want to meet, but really, people, it's 2012.
This simple tool can help to put you in contact with people you might want to be friends with directly, ignoring the middle-man.

# Why does this exist?

1. I want to learn how to build things with Node.js, Coffeescript, and maybe Websockets.
2. I am moving to San Francisco in June and I have maybe one friend in the Bay Area (shoutout to my cousin Anna!).
